# contact-list

##Disclaimer
 - Few liberties were taken with dimensions as I did not have an independent image to scale
   nor a the dimensions. I have tried to keep things as close to mock up as possible.
 - Colors and fonts were matched as close as possible - specifications did not contain details for them
 - The green badge over contact image could not be added because I need the image.
   I took a stab using image editing tools, but quality was not coming out well.
